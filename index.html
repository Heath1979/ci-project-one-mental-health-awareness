                <p>It was estimated in 2019 that 15% of working age adults suffer from some form of mental disorder, and
                    that
                    around 12 billion working days are lost annually due to depression and anxiety. The purpose of the
                    Mental
                    Health outreach programme is to help organisations train volunteers in recognising common issues,
                    and
                    have
                    the
                    confidence to support colleagues as required.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of MHFA's</h2>
                <p>MHFA training, along with other equally valuable mental health training courses, help people in our
                    communities to understand that help is possible and getting ill is preventable. The courses also
                    help to
                    remove the shame that is so often associated with the stigma of being mentally unwell. Through the
                    skills
                    taught on the course, participants feel more confident in recognising when someone might be
                    experiencing
                    mental health issues and offering a first line of support – either through non-judgemental listening
                    or
                    by
                    guiding them to appropriate services. By offering this support at an earlier stage than might have
                    ordinarily happened, MHFA is encouraging early intervention and recovery. As importantly, MHFA also
                    educates
                    people on what keeps us mentally well and therefore prevents some people getting ill in the first
                    place.
